# gochi
Very quick REST API with Go and a Redis store.
Following a NetNinja tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iImF8w9FbFOc2UntutL9Wv

## Future Plans
Expand to multiple services, could possibly be integrated to [my other Go repo](https://github.com/daffaromero/gomicro).
To add:
- gRPC or Kafka (unsure)
- A more robust store (Postgres?)
- Relegate Redis to cache???? (very unrealistic as of now)
